           <h1>Tribute Of Kenya’s former President and longest serving Member of Parliament Emilio Mwai Kibaki  </h1>
            
<p1><br>His death was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta Friday at State House Nairobi and led Kenyans in mourning Kibaki, who served as President from 2002- 2013.

He served as a legislator, Member of Parliament for Five Decades, a Cabinet Minister, Vice-President, Official Leader of Opposition and finally as the Third President of the Republic of Kenya.

While eulogizing the former Head of State, President Kenyatta described Kibaki as a leader who strove so hard and accomplished so much for his country.
President Kenyatta said Mwai Kibaki was a quintessential patriot, whose legacy of civic responsibility will continue to inspire generations of Kenyans long into the future.

“We remember the values by which he lived, the ideals he embraced, his dignity, his diligence, candor, and concern for the well-being of all Kenyans,” said the President.<br></p1>


<p2><br> President said that the late Kibaki will forever remembered as the gentleman of Kenyan Politics, a brilliant debater; whose eloquence, wit, and charm won the day, time and-time again.

Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’I said that he will remember Mzee Kibaki for his unique and admirable style of leadership that singularly focused on the effective management of the affairs of our great nation.

He termed the retired President as a sober and reflective statesman who eschewed flippancy in public service.

“His legendary intolerance for political pettiness and side-shows in favour of national development priorities will remain an entrenched legacy worth of admiration and emulation,” said<br> </p2>



<p3><br>After handing over the leadership mantle to his successor, President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kibaki left behind a rich development legacy that will forever be remembered by the people of Kenya.

Kibaki was a powerful public figure and his legend was etched in stone in 1974 when Time, the most decorated American publication, named him among 100 people in the world likely to become Heads of States.

38 years later, in 2002, what Time predicted came to pass. He was elected the Third Presidnt of the Republic of Kenya. This was after unsuccessfully contesting for the country's top job in 1992 and 1997 on a Democratic Party (DP) ticket.
on December 29, 2002, at Uhuru Park, Kibaki made his inaugural speech promising democracy and prosperity. 20 years down the line, Kenyans hail him as one of the greatest Presidents ever
He brought back the dwindling fortunes of the Kenyan economy, built infrastructure, collected revenue, and rehabilitated schools. It was during his tenure that Kenyan tourism sprouted back to life and businesses flourished.<br></p3>



<h3>Five major projects that Kibaki will be forever remembered for</h3>
<ol><li>The Constitution of Kenya 2010</li><li>Free Primary Education</li>
<li>Constituency Development Fund (CDF)</li><li>Thika Superhighway</li><li>Economy</li>
</ol>
